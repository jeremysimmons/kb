If you want to completely disable the SKU feature then you have to use wc_product_sku_enabled filter.
It will remove the SKU field from both backend and frontend.

add_filter( 'wc_product_sku_enabled', '__return_false' );

If you want to keep the SKU feature but need to disable unique SKU check then you have to use wc_product_has_unique_sku filter. 
It will keep the SKU field in both backend and frontend, but will allow you to add multiple duplicate SKU.

add_filter( 'wc_product_has_unique_sku', '__return_false' );
