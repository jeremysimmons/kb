Testing SSL with your certificate using s_client

Steps to test SSL:  create a cert/key pair then use c_client

Export from Firefox/IE (**If there are key usages use Digital Signature  from RFC)
or run certmgr.msc in Windows.
The resulting pcks12 (.pfx, .p12) can be converted to PEM format

openssl pkcs12 -in <.p12 filename> -out <new pem cert filename> -nodes

export the private key from the pkcs12 with the -nocerts flag

openssl pkcs12 -in <.p12 filename> -out <key pem key filename> -nodes -nocerts

test with openssl s_client
	
openssl s_client -connect <host:port> -cert <cert.pem> -key <key.pem> [-CApath <dir with CA certs>]

A successful connection will stay open (for a bit) waiting for input – if openssl s_client goes back to the prompt there was an error.

Look for something like CONNECTED(00000003) and make sure that there are no errors immediately following.
openssl can give an error, "sslv3 alert certificate unknown:s3_pkt.c:1256:SSL alert number 46" can come back for wrong key usage
error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain can be ok – it is just referring to the root cert
