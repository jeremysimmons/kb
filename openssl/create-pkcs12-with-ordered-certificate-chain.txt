How to create a pkcs12 file with a ordered certificate chain?

1.) Create a empty file (C:\temp\cert-chain.txt) put the following inside it:

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Primary SSL certificate from C:\temp\your_domain_name.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Intermediate certificate from C:\temp\TheIntermediateCA.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Root certificate part from C:\temp\TheTrustedRoot.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

2.) Now replace the content inside the brackets with your certificates (which you can export via XCA; PEM txt format). The order above is VERY important so do not mix it!

2.) Export the private key (unencrypted in text format) with XCA from your certificate and store it inside  C:\temp\server.pemkey

3.) Now merge everything together as pkcs12 (filename extension for PKCS #12 files is .p12 or .pfx). To do that open a CMD (run as admin) and perform:

openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey C:\temp\server.pemkey -in C:\temp\cert-chain.txt -password pass:ABCD -out C:\temp\certificate(chain_and_key).pfx

4.) Your PFX file is now ready to be used
