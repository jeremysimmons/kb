Run
1. Providing a test class name executes all tests in that test class. If a SetUp stored procedure exists in that test class, then it is executed before each test.
2. Providing a test case name executes that single test.
3. Providing no parameter value executes tSQLt.Run the same way the previous call to tSQLt.Run was made when a parameter was provided. 

RunAll
If the test class schema contains a stored procedure called SetUp, it is executed before calling each test case.
