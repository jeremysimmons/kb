Usually you want this:
$ git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
example
$ git push origin :branch
$ git branch -d <branch_name>

Delete Local Branch
git branch -d branch_name
git branch -D branch_name
The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status."

Delete Remote Branch
git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>
git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
git push --delete <remote_name> <branch_name>
