git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2
git diff --name-only HEAD~10 HEAD~5

is like --name-only, except you get a simple prefix telling you what happened to the file (modified, deleted, added...)
git diff --name-status [SHA1 [SHA2]]

File status flags:
M modified - File has been modified
C copy-edit - File has been copied and modified
R rename-edit - File has been renamed and modified
A added - File has been added
D deleted - File has been deleted
U unmerged - File has conflicts after a merge
