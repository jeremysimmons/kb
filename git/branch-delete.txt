https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-remotely

delete a remote branch on the server (assuming origin is the name of the remote)
$ git push origin --delete <branch_name>
$ git push origin :<branch_name>

delete locally (only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch)
$ git branch -d <branch_name>
delete locally (without checking merge status)
$ git branch -D <branch_name>

remember to cleanup afterwards
git fetch --all --prune
