Patching is a way to share out one branch commit to another developer or another branch
Create a patch fixemptyposter branch against master:
git format-patch master --stdout > fixemptyposter.patch
Above command create a patch file which has all commits which is present on fixemptyposter branch but not on master

Applying the patch
git apply --stat fixemptyposter.patch
This will show commits which is present in path file

Patch also provide a way to test code before applying
git apply --check fixemptyposter.patch

Apply patch on branch
git am --signoff < fixemptyposter.patch
Above command add all patch commit to current branch

For generating the patches from the topmost commits from a specific sha1 hash:
git format-patch -<n> <SHA1> --stdout > ntosha1.patch

The last 10 patches from head in a single patch file:
git format-patch -10 HEAD --stdout > 0001-last-10-commits.patch

To generate path from a specific commit (not the last commit):
git format-patch -1 <sha> --stdout > specific_commit.patch
