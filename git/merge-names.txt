When you invoke git mergetool on a conflict, it will produce these files suitable for feeding into a typical 3-way merge tool.

foo.LOCAL: the "ours" side of the conflict - ie, your branch (HEAD) that will contain the results of the merge
foo.REMOTE: the "theirs" side of the conflict - the branch you are merging into HEAD
foo.BASE: the common ancestor. useful for feeding into a three-way merge tool
foo.BACKUP: the contents of file before invoking the merge tool, will be kept on the filesystem if mergetool.keepBackup = true.
