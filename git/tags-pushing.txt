git push --follow-tags

git config --global push.followTags true


It pushes both commits and only tags that are both:
+ annotated
+ reachable (an ancestor) from the pushed commits
is is sane because:
you should only push annotated tags to the remote, and keep lightweight tags for local development to avoid tag clashes.

Delete a Tag on origin
git tag -d 12345
git push origin :refs/tags/12345

AVOID USING THESE!

To push a single tag:
git push origin <tag_name>

And the following command should push all tags (not recommended):
git push --tags

To push a moved tag
git push origin <tag_name> --force
