Not a base image, but related capability to build images
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib
Jib builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon

Distroless https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/tree/main/java
- Non-root user
- contain only java applications and their runtime dependencies
  (contain package managers, shells, or other programs typically included in a standard Linux distribution, This results in a smaller attack surface.)
- An attacker cannot change a live container by installing packages or accessing environment variables, check the filesystem, investigate the network, list the running processes, or perform other damaging actions. This is because a Distroless image doesnâ€™t include any shell binaries.
