Log out as admin (below "admin" is meant as name of the admin user account - adapt accordingly) and login as foo.
Open the Terminal and enter:

su admin
sudo dscl . create /Users/admin IsHidden 1
If you want to remove the login screen's "Others..." option, which appears after disabling the admin account, enter:

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE
To reverse the hidden admin user and enable "Others..." again enter:

su admin
sudo dscl . create /Users/admin IsHidden 0
sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED
