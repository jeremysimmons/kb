If you have brew installed with multiple PHP versions i.e. 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 on Mac OS X mojave, you can to do the following:

Install autoconf with brew brew install autoconf.

Change to the PHP version that you want Xdebug on, run brew unlink php@7.1 && brew link --force --overwrite php. This will switch from PHP 7.1 to PHP 7.3.

Download the latest Xdebug source from xdebug website.

Extract the Xdebug tar and navigate to extracted directory, where you'd see all the files.

Run phpize to configure the build for the new Zend engine.

Run ./configure.

Run make.

Xdebug extension xdebug.so gets compiled in modules directory.

Create a new directory path under /usr/local/lib/php/7.3.1/extensions/ and copy xdebug.so to this location. Here, 7.3.1 is the current version that I switched earlier, change this to match your PHP version.

Open php.ini in an editor and enter
zend_extension="/usr/local/lib/php/7.3.1/extensions/xdebug.so" then save the change.

Run php -v and it will show Xdebug has been configured correctly
