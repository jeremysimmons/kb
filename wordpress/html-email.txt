Is there a way to send HTML formatted emails with WordPress' wp_mail() function?

$to = 'sendto@example.com';
$subject = 'The subject';
$body = 'The email body content';
$headers = array('Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8');

wp_mail( $to, $subject, $body, $headers );

alternate syntax 

$email_to = 'someaddress@gmail.com';
$email_subject = 'Email subject';

// <<<EOD it is PHP heredoc syntax
$email_body = <<<EOD
This is your new <b style="color: red; font-style: italic;">password</b> : {$password}
EOD;

$headers = ['Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8'];

$send_mail = wp_mail( $email_to, $email_subject, $email_body, $headers );
