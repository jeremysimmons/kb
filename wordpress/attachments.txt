https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/194090/what-is-the-different-between-an-attachment-in-wp-posts-and-an-attachment-in-wp

An attachment is a Post
The posts table contains information on the attachment post.

In WordPress every uploaded media has it's own post entry, where post_type is 'attachment' and post_status is 'inherit'.

In fact, you can get attachment post types using functions used to get other post types, like post, page or any CPT.

That includes WP_Query, get_posts() and get_post().

What's in posts table
For every attachment post

post_title column is used for attachment title
post_excerpt is used for attachment caption
post_content is used for attachment description
Note that attachment post type may have a post_parent that points to the ID of the post where the attachment was uploaded from.

For example:

get_posts( 'post_type=attachment&post_parent=10' );
Retrieve all the post objects for attachments loaded from the edit page of the post with ID 10;

An attachment is not only a Post
However, there is information for media (especially images) that simply doesn't fit the posts table.

All this information is stored in the postmeta table, where the post_id column refers to the attachment row in the posts table.

What's in postmeta table
For example, the "alt" attribute is stored in a meta field that has the key '_wp_attachment_image_alt'.

The meta field with key '_wp_attached_file' contains the relative path (to content folder) of the uploaded file.

That is used to build the attachment URL and path, in functions like wp_get_attachment_url(), wp_get_attachment_image_src(), get_attached_file() and so on.

Finally, the field '_wp_attachment_metadata' contains different information (in a serialized array in the database):

The image size (under keys 'width' and 'height')
Information about intermediate sizes
Intermediate sizes
In fact, every time an image is uploaded, WordPress creates different copies of the image in different sizes.

Please read this answer for more details.

The key "sizes" in the '_wp_attachment_metadata' field contain an array with information on all generated images: the file created, the size (width and height) and so on.

Note that the preferred way to get information from '_wp_attachment_metadata' is not using the common get_post_meta() but the specific wp_get_attachment_metadata(), as it triggers a filter.

If you are interested in the information about a specific generated image, the function image_get_intermediate_size() will be handy.

Use specific functions
Generally speaking, if you need information on an attachment, use the specific functions and avoid pulling data from the database; it is harder and does not triggers hooks, possibly breaking core, theme and plugins compatibility.

There are a lot of functions in WordPress to work with attachments, this should give you an idea...

However, main functions are all listed in this answer.
