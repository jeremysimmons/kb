error_reporting 
https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php

E_ALL is "everything"

E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE is "everything except notices"

E_ALL    = 111111111111111
E_NOTICE = 000000000001000
           111111111110111


E_ALL would should all the error and warning and notice - everything

E_NOTICE is a special error level, showing things that won't produce error but are not good or gonna be obsolete in future release of PHP. The notice error level is meant to encourage best practices.

Also it should be error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE); to report everything except notice.
