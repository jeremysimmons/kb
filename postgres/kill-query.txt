How to stop/kill a query in postgresql

SELECT pid , query, * from pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state != 'idle' ORDER BY xact_start;
or

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

Find the process you want to kill, then type:

SELECT pg_cancel_backend(<pid of the process>)
This basically "starts" a request to terminate gracefully, which may be satisfied after some time, though the query comes back immediately.

If the process cannot be killed, try:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<pid of the process>)
