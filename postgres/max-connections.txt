Idle connections: You can view the idle connections in an RDS for PostgreSQL instance by running the following query. This query displays information about backend processes with one of the following states for more than 15 minutes: 'idle', 'idle in transaction', 'idle in transaction (aborted)' and 'disabled'.

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pid <> pg_backend_pid()
AND state in ('idle', 'idle in transaction', 'idle in transaction (aborted)', 'disabled')
AND state_change < current_timestamp - INTERVAL '15' MINUTE;
To terminate an idle connection in an RDS for PostgreSQL instance, run the following command:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(example-pid)
