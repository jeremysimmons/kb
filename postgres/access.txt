How to grant access to users in PostgreSQL?
Here are some common statement to grant access to a PostgreSQL user:

1. Grant CONNECT to the database:

GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name TO username;
2. Grant USAGE on schema:

GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
3. Grant on all tables for DML statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
4. Grant all privileges on all tables in the schema:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
5. Grant all privileges on all sequences in the schema:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA schema_name TO username;
6. Grant all privileges on the database:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO username;
7. Grant permission to create database:

ALTER USER username CREATEDB;
8. Make a user superuser:

ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER;
9. Remove superuser status:

ALTER USER username WITH NOSUPERUSER;
Those statements above only affect the current existing tables. To apply to newly created tables, you need to use alter default. For example:

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
FOR USER username
IN SCHEMA schema_name
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO username;
