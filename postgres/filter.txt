SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS unfiltered,
  SUM( CASE WHEN i < 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) AS filtered
FROM generate_series(1,10) AS s(i);

It will count every case in unfiltered counter and when i < 5 it will sum 1 to the filtered counter. This is how Iâ€™ve coded many times in my reports.

more elegant syntax

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS unfiltered,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE i < 5) AS filtered
FROM generate_series(1,10) AS s(i);
