ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -c:a libvorbis -q:a 4 output.ogg

Whole directory at a time
for f in ./*.mp3; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -c:a libvorbis -q:a 4 "${f/%mp3/ogg}"; done

Recursively, with find:

find . -type f -name '*.mp3' -exec bash -c 'ffmpeg -i "$0" -c:a libvorbis -q:a 4 "${0/%mp3/ogg}"' '{}' \;


Set the output quality by adjusting the value of -q:a: for this codec the range is 0-10 and higher gives better quality.

On older versions of ffmpeg, you may need to use -acodec and -aq instead of -c:a and -q:a.

Of course, converting from one lossy format to another is not ideal; but such is life.
