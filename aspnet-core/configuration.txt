For the truly brave, there's now a configuration experience where you can start with a minimal MVC pipeline and add features to get a customized framework.

ublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddMvcCore()
        .AddAuthorization()
        .AddJsonFormatters(j => j.Formatting = Formatting.Indented);
}
