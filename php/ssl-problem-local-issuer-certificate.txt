SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

Download the certificate bundle.

Put it somewhere. In my case, that was c:\wamp\ directory (if you are using Wamp 64 bit then it's c:\wamp64\).

Enable mod_ssl in Apache and php_openssl.dll in php.ini (uncomment them by removing ; at the beginning). But be careful, my problem was that I had two php.ini files and I need to do this in both of them. One is the one you get from your WAMP taskbar icon, and another one is, in my case, in C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.5.12\

Add these lines to your cert in both php.ini files:

curl.cainfo="C:/wamp/cacert.pem"
openssl.cafile="C:/wamp/cacert.pem"
Restart Wamp services.
