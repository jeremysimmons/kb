function array_clone($array) {
    return array_map(function($element) {
        return ((is_array($element))
            ? array_clone($element)
            : ((is_object($element))
                ? clone $element
                : $element
            )
        );
    }, $array);
}

Is there a function to make a copy of a PHP array to another?


In PHP arrays are assigned by copy, while objects are assigned by reference. This means that:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/1533214/26877
$a = array();
$b = $a;
$b['foo'] = 42;
var_dump($a);
Will yield:

array(0) {
}
Whereas:

$a = new StdClass();
$b = $a;
$b->foo = 42;
var_dump($a);
Yields:

object(stdClass)#1 (1) {
  ["foo"]=>
  int(42)
}
You could get confused by intricacies such as ArrayObject, which is an object that acts exactly like an array. Being an object however, it has reference semantics.
