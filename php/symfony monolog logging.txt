The ! prefix tells Monolog to log all channels except event. You can exclude more channels (e.g. channels: [!event, !doctrine]) and you can leave it empty to start logging event messages again.

In addition, this change can be applied to all your existing Symfony applications, regardless of the Symfony version they use. Just add channels: [!event] to your Monolog configuration in config_dev.yml and say goodbye to those annoying log messages.
