Is there an XSLT name-of element?

<xsl:value-of select ="local-name()"/>

<xsl:value-of select ="name(.)"/>

name(someNode) returns the full name of the node, and that includes the prefix and colon in case the node is an element or an attribute.

local-name(someNode) returns only the local name of the node, and that doesn't include the prefix and colon in case the node is an element or an attribute.

name() is an abbreviation for name(.)

local-name() is an abbreviation for local-name(.)
