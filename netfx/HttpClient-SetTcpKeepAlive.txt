So now I end up answering my own question as I just have found a super simple solution that actually works:

this.httpclient = new HttpClient();
var sp = ServicePointManager.FindServicePoint(new Uri(url));
sp.SetTcpKeepAlive(true, 30000, 30000);
result = await this.httpclient.GetAsync(url);
In fact I used

var sp = ServicePointManager.FindServicePoint(new Uri(baseUrl));
where baseUrl is the common document root of all my requests I am sending through a for loop.
