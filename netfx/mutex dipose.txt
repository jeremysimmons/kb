I don't trust that code sample in the Mutex class docs where the mutex object is not disposed. Although Henzi has a good point in comment: 
The Mutex object is static and would be either disposed by the finalizer or destroyed by the Windows kernel when the process exits.

Use the CloseHandle function to close the handle. The system closes the handle automatically when the process terminates. The mutex object is destroyed when its last handle has been closed.
