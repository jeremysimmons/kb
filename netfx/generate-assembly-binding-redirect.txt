Fortunately, the SDK can generate these for you automatically. This is even the new default for projects which target .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher.

If you want to opt into this behaviour, you can define the following MSBuild property in your project file, or in Directory.Build.props:

<AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
However, this only works for executable projects (Console Application, Windows Forms application, etc.). If you want this to work for other projects - for example, a Class Library that contains unit tests, you need to add one more MSBuild property:

<GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>true</GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType>
With those two flags set, then as long as your project directly references the newer version of a transitive dependency, your program will load the newest version, even when your dependencies are built against an older version.
