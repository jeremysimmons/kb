@FransBouma you can access your registered factory the same ways as the old ways in .NET Frameworks.

DbFactories.GetFactory(string providerInvariantName);
DbFactories.GetFactory(DbConnection connection);
In CoreFx, you will need to use DbProviderFactoriesConfiguration to register your provider.

DbProviderFactoriesConfiguration.Add("Sytem.Data.SqlClient", () => SqlClientFactory.Instance);
But in .NET Frameworks, you don't need to do anything, it will read from the machine config as it is.
