ASP.NET Core supports a convention-based approach to configuring an application's startup based on the current environment.

When an ASP.NET Core application starts, the Startup class is used to bootstrap the application

if a class exists named Startup{EnvironmentName} (for example StartupDevelopment), and the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable matches that name, then that Startup class is used instead

Configure() and ConfigureServices() methods support environment-specific versions similar to the Startup class itself, of the form Configure{EnvironmentName}() and Configure{EnvironmentName}Services()
