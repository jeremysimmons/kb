Workflow rule that would fire on insert of Lead and send you an email (or if it's for system integration - outbound message).
You can always write an "after insert" Apex trigger and have in it a callout to external system (SOAP and RESTful APIs are supported). Although you'll need an extra @future trick because the triggers by default aren't supposed to send callouts (the database commit/rollback shouldn't depend on whether the external system has accepted the message or not).
