You'll need to test the method directly, and test the Queueable separately. The easiest way to do so is a static flag.

public class MyQueueable implements Queueable
    @TestVisible static Boolean makeCallout = true;
    public void execute(QueueableContext context)
    {
        if (makeCallout) performCallout();
    }
    public static void performCallout()
    {
        // make callout here
    }
}
Testing the job:

Test.startTest();
    MyQueueable.makeCallout = false;
    // enqueue job
Test.stopTest();
Then test your method which actually makes the callout separately:

Test.startTest();
    MyQueueable.performCallout();
Test.stopTest();
The reason you get this error is that when you enqueue the job, that counts as a DML Operation. Then when you call Test.stopTest(), it runs synchronously, making a callout within the same transaction.
