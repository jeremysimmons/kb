Activity - a single focused thing that a user can do
maintains activities on a stack - popping an activity when touching 'back'
returns to launcher if the stack is empty
<activity>
<intent-filter>
<action/>
<category />
</intent-filter>
</activity>

activities have a layout

setContentView(...)
findViewById(...)

layouts have views
(android.widget) - interaction components
TextView - display text - a label
EditText - edit text - an inputbox
ImageView - draw an image
Button - something you tap on 
Chronometer - a simple timer 

layout or container views
abstract ViewGroup
LinearLayout - single column or row
RelativeLayout - relative position to eachother and the view
FrameLayout - contains a single child view
ScrollView - a scroll through the content
ConstraintLayout - (newer) provides flexibility 

width and height
dp - density-independent pixels. e.g. 200pd or 300pd
wrap_content = shrink to wrap what is inside the view (measure text)
match_parent = expand to be as large as the parent view
sp - dp + user's scale preference - use this for text
