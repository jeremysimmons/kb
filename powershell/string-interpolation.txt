PowerShell string interpolation syntax

$foo = 'bar'  # example variable

# INCORRECT: PowerShell assumes that the variable name is 'foobarian', not 'foo'
PS> "A $foobarian."
A .  # Variable $foobarian doesn't exist -> reference expanded to empty string.

# CORRECT: Use {...} to delineate the variable name:
PS> "A ${foo}barian."
A barbarian.

# INCORRECT: PowerShell assumes that 'foo:' is a *namespace* (drive) reference
#            (such as 'env:' in $env:PATH) and FAILS:
PS> "$foo: bar"
Variable reference is not valid. ':' was not followed by a valid variable name character. 
Consider using ${} to delimit the name.

# CORRECT: Use {...} to delineate the variable name:
PS> "${foo}: bar"
bar: bar
