Git Status Summary Information

The Git status summary information provides a wealth of "Git status" information at a glance, all the time in your prompt.

By default, the status summary has the following format:

[{HEAD-name} S +A ~B -C !D | +E ~F -G !H W]
[ (BeforeText)
{HEAD-name} is the current branch, or the SHA of a detached HEAD
Cyan means the branch matches its remote
Green means the branch is ahead of its remote (green light to push)
Red means the branch is behind its remote
Yellow means the branch is both ahead of and behind its remote
S represents the branch status in relation to remote (tracked origin) branch. 
Note: This information reflects the state of the remote tracked branch after the last git fetch/pull of the remote.
≡ = The local branch in at the same commit level as the remote branch (BranchIdenticalStatus)
↑<num> = The local branch is ahead of the remote branch by the specified number of commits; 
         a 'git push' is required to update the remote branch (BranchAheadStatus)
↓<num> = The local branch is behind the remote branch by the specified number of commits;
         a 'git pull' is required to update the local branch (BranchBehindStatus)
<a>↕<b> = The local branch is both ahead of the remote branch by the specified number of commits (a) 
          and behind by the specified number of commits (b); 
          a rebase of the local branch is required before pushing local changes to the remote branch (BranchBehindAndAheadStatus). 
          NOTE: this status is only available if $GitPromptSettings.BranchBehindAndAheadDisplay is set to 'Compact'.
× = The local branch is tracking a branch that is gone from the remote (`BranchGoneStatus')
ABCD represent the index; | (DelimText); EFGH represent the working directory
+ = Added files
~ = Modified files
- = Removed files
! = Conflicted files
As in git status, index status is dark green and working directory status is dark red
W represents the status of the working folder
! = There are untracked changes in the working tree (LocalStagedStatus)
~ = There are staged changes in the working tree waiting to be committed (LocalWorkingStatus)
None = There are no uncommitted or unstaged changes to the working tree (LocalDefault)
