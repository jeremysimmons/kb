sometimes you want to create a file with contents from the console/terminal

in DOS, you would use copy con <filename> 

> copy con my-file.txt
glorious file contents
with many lines without line continuation characters
this is bliss
^-Z

in bash, you use cat with a 
$ cat << ENDL > my-file.txt
glorious file contents
with many lines without line continuation characters
this is bliss
ENDL
