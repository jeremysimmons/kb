pv -l makes pv to count by newlines instead of bytes
pv -s number tells pv what the total is so that it can give you an estimation.
The redirect to logfile at the end is for clean output. Otherwise the status line from pv gets mixed up with the output from rm -v. Bonus: you will have a logfile of what was deleted. But beware the file will get huge. You can also redirect to /dev/null if you don't need a log.
