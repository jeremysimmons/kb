Flex Container
children: Flex Items

container
display: flex;
display: flex-inline; - only width children require

items display will still be block

flex flows from left to right on the Main Axis
flex start on left, flex end on right

flex-direction: row (default)
row-reverse goes right to left.
[3][2][1] - markup order didn't change, but rendering did

vertical flow
flex-direction: column (top to bottom)
column-reverse (bottom to top)

[Flex Line Wrapping]
used-to use...
text-wrap: nowrap (default behavior for flex)
Single Line Formatting:
Multi-Line Formatting:

flex-wrap: nowrap;
flex-wrap: wrap;

flex-flow: row no-wrap;

flex-wrap: specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not
nowrap	     Default value. Specifies that the flexible items will not wrap
wrap	     Specifies that the flexible items will wrap if necessary
wrap-reverse Specifies that the flexible items will wrap, if necessary, in reverse order
initial	     Sets this property to its default value.

flex-grow:   how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container
flex-shrink: how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container
flex-basis:  the initial length of a flexible item

flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;

[Alignment]
justify-content: aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).
Tip: Use the align-items property to align the items on the cross-axis (vertically).
flex-start	Default value. Items are positioned at the beginning of the container
flex-end	Items are positioned at the end of the container
center	        Items are positioned at the center of the container
space-between	Items are positioned with space between the lines
space-around	Items are positioned with space before, between, and after the lines

align-items: specifies the default alignment for items inside the flexible container.
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_align-items&preval=stretch
Tip: Use the align-self property of each item to override the align-items property.
stretch	Default. Items are stretched to fit the container
center	Items are positioned at the center of the container
flex-start	Items are positioned at the beginning of the container
flex-end	Items are positioned at the end of the container
baseline	Items are positioned at the baseline of the container

align-content: modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines.
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_align-content&preval=stretch
stretch	Default value. Lines stretch to take up the remaining space	
center	Lines are packed toward the center of the flex container	
flex-start	Lines are packed toward the start of the flex container	
flex-end	Lines are packed toward the end of the flex container	
space-between	Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container	
space-around	Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container, with half-size spaces on either end
