If you don't mind a machine-wide registry change, you can configure Windows to use the form ProcessName_ProcessID for Perf Counter instance names, rather than appending #1, #2, etc:

Create DWORD HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PerfProc\Performance\ProcessNameFormat and set its value to 2.

<processModel autoConfig="true"

             maxWorkerThreads = "100"

             maxIoThreads = "100"

             minWorkerThreads = "50"

             minIoThreads = "50"

         />
