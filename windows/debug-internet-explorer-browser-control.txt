You can get JavaScript console output from within Visual Studio.

By default the webBrowser1 control uses IE7 to render it's output. 
IE7 does not have a console.log() function. 
In order to get the console.log() function to work, you need to add the following meta tag:

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=11">
'IE=8' or greater should make the console.log() available to you.

When you debug a Windows Forms application it debugs using the .NET Managed Code debugger. 
In order to debug differently, instead of pressing 'Play' to debug, try selecting "Debug" > "Start without Debugging". 
Now once your application is running, go to "Debug" > "Attach to Process" and find your WindowsFormsApplication.exe, attach to it using the Script Code Debugger instead of the .NET Managed Code debugger.

Now, in Visual Studio:

You can open "Debug" > "Windows" > "JavaScript Console"
You can also open "Debug" > "Windows" > "DOM Explorer"
