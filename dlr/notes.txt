A ScriptRunTime manages the global script scope and one or many ScriptEngines. 
A ScriptEngine encapsulates a dynamic programming language. 

A SciptScope acts as a namespace for scripted members. 

A ScriptSource is an abstraction of a piece of source code to execute or compile. 
CompiledCode represents a compiled script or expression that may be executed. 
CompiledCode objects are created from a ScriptSource and are optimized for fast execution.
